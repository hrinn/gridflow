## Installation
1. Navigate to the [latest release](https://github.com/hrinn/gridflow/releases/tag/v1.1).
2. Download and extract GridFlowInstaller.zip.
3. Run the installer.
4. Run the application from the Desktop or Start menu shortcut.
5. **If the application fails to run, re-run it as an administrator.** This is likely because it could not create the Credentials.json file in Program Data/GridFlow. You will only have to do this on first launch.
